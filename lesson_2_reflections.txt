What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
		git creates a .git folder and allows you to start creating commits when you initialize a
		repository. Without doing this you cannot create commits.
		
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do 
you think it offers?
	The staging area is where you add files that you want to commit. You may not want to commit 
	all of the files in a working directory, so that is why the staging area exists.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	I can use the staging area to put only the files I want to commit in.
