When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You would want to use a remote repository if you were collaborating with other people, want to make
  your work public, or want to work on your project from multiple computers.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up to date with your remote repository?
	You don't want pulls to be done automatically, because it makes things easier when colaborating. 
	You may also not want to share certain things until they are finished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead 
of the other?
	To fork a repository is to make a copy from one github user to another, cloning is making
	a copy on your local computer, and branches is making a copy within commits.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	The benegit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is
	the ability to work without being online and know how far ahead you are from the remote version.
	It also allows people to colaborate easier and any conflicts can be solved later.
